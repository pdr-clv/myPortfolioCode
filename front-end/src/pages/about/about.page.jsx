      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Hi! my name is Pedro, I am Spanish full stuck web developer. I was graduated in Physics for the University of Valencia, and now located in Moscow . Here is my story about how I became developer.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>My first steps developing:</b> In University I already used software to do researches, but real start was when I worked in automotive Industry. I managed huge data in Excel Worksheets. During this time I developed Windows Apps with Visual Basic and Access using mySQL local databases.</li>
        <li><b>Static web developing:</b> In 2017 I started the basics of FrontEnd. HTML5, CSS3 (responsive, Bootstrap), JS.</li>
        <li><b>Dinamic web developing:</b> To became full stuck developer, I focused more in JS (JQuery ES6), and also backEnd progamming PHP (mySQL CRUD and asynchronous calls with Ajax).</li>
        <li><b>Developing with new frameworks:</b> Use of React.js to develop frontEnd structure, separated and perfectly integrated in the backEnd Node.js + Mongodb and Firebase (REST API).</li>
      </ul>
