Styling a web, creating responsive styles and placing all elements in the right place it is a job must be done with accurancy, and takes much time. This makes the difference between good and normal frontend developers.',

      "I believe React has the solution of many problems I found in my previous projects developed with pure javascript.Despite this, I think another frameworks like Angular or Vue provides similar solutions. I think I can adapt to any of other frontend frameworks. After learning the first framework, everything goes faster later for another one. I admit I'd like to improve in future testing performances and typescript to make code asier to debug."

In the past I used PHP + mySQL now I see how that code was not so structured, it was merged frontend + backend together. Nowadays I am more focused in node.js + MongoDB to create an API with the endpoints to request later from the frontend.',
