      'My recent experience nowadays is focused in react.js, with strong knowledge of javascript to fetch data from backend, also I use styled-components for styles. Styling a web, creating responsive styles and placing all elements in the right place it is a job must be done with accurancy, and takes much time. This makes the difference between good and normal frontend developers.',
      'Thanks to react, everytime it is faster to create new sites, re-using your components from previous projects, and you can gain time in frontend developing, scalability and good understanding for the rest of the team',
      'Performance of React applications is very fast, renders only the necessary elements, withouth reloading whole website. React redux goes one step further, providing state data to components that need it. React also works Client Side Rendering (CSR), and performance of server is also faster.',
      "I believe React has the solution of many problems I found in my previous projects I developed with classical javascript + html + css. Despite this, I think another frameworks like Angular or Vue provide similar solutions. I think I can adapt to any of other frontend frameworks. After developing with react, working with another frontend framework it is matter of adaptation."

      'But I think it is not enough just managing frontend, if you want your career growing in web developing. In the past I used PHP + mySQL now I see how that code was not so structured, it was merged frontend + backend together. Nowadays I am more focused in node.js + MongoDB (noSQL database) to create an API with the endpoints to request later from the frontend.',
      'My profile it is also called MERN full stuck (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)',
      'As a good backend developer, it is important to pay special attention on user auth and security, error handling, create a good folder structure (MVC) of project for the good understanding of your code, and good organization of collection, embedding or normalizating data in your documents.',
      'Performance of MongoDB database is completely adapted to new times, stored in the cloud, with no need of physical servers, like it was done in the past. Scalability it is a matter of hiring new services',
      'Firebase it is also a non-SQL fast and good solution for reasonable backend size project. Here there is no need to create a backend folder structure so strict like MongoDB. I like the user auth services provides Firebase.'

      "<b><u>Motivation (2000's):</u></b> Internet became more accesible to people,it was the origin of e-commerce. I will never forget first time I bought a plane ticket with Internet. Something so normal nowadays, in that moment for me it was unbelieveable. It was interesting for me to know how this could be done under the hood, despite I had no the answer.",
      '<b><u>Logistics career:</u></b> This was the first time I realized Excel was not the best tool to work in a team in order to have all the updated data. It was fustrating to make wrong decissions just because data was not good. Here I discover all the good performance you could get with a simple database for the team. Here I start my selft-taught career in IT. I started with mySQL, Access and Visual Basic.',
      'During this period of time I developed Windows applications like <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg5pircnj/image/upload/v1599112875/PortfolioApp/production-study_at1eyj.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Production Study</a> and <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg5pircnj/image/upload/v1599112885/PortfolioApp/reciclajes-v1_xtoqov.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reciclying</a>',

It is not using modern development tools, but in that moment I felt very proud to develop by myself this real business solution.',
