      'My recent experience nowadays is focused in react.js, with strong knowledge of javascript to fetch data from backend, also I use styled-components for styles. Styling a web, creating responsive styles and placing all elements in the right place it is a job must be done with accurancy, and takes much time. This makes the difference between good and normal frontend developers.',
      'Thanks to react, everytime it is faster to re-use your components from previous projects, and you can gain time in frontend developing, scalability and good understanding for the rest of the team',
      'Performance of React applications is very fast, renders only the necessary elements, withouth reloading whole website. React redux is brilliant to optimize CSR to release activity from server.',
      "I believe React has the solution of many problems I found in my previous projects I developed with classical javascript + html + css. Despite this, I think another frameworks like Angular or Vue provide similar solutions. I think I can adapt to any of other frontend frameworks. After developing with react, working with another frontend framework it is matter of adaptation."

      'But I think it is not enough just to manage frontend, if you want your career to grow in web developing. In the past I used PHP + mySQL now I see how that code was not so structured, it was merged frontend + backend together. Nowadays I am more focused in node.js + MongoDB to create an API with the endpoints to request later from the frontend.',
      'My profile it is also called MERN full stuck (MongoDB + Express + React + Node.js)',
      'As a good backend developer, it is important to pay special attention on user auth and security, error handling, create a good folder structure (MVC) of project for the good understanding of your code, and good organization of collections and documents with the right relationship of data.',
      'MongoDB is completely adapted to new times, with all databases stored in the cloud, with no need of physical servers, like it was done in the past. Scalability it is a matter of hiring new services'
